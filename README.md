Hey All
This is a ToDo List made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and MongoDB.
Packages needed : Node, Nodemon, Lodash, mongoose.
I used MongoDB Atlas for the backend. 
index.html code is written for the webpage landing. 
styles.css written to design the background color of the page. Other elements such as heading, input, button have also been styled.
app.js is the heart of the webpage which connects all others and gives life to the webpage. 
list.ejs is written to direct the input taken to app.js and to further work on that input. 
MongoDB is used to store the data given.
